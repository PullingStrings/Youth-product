They face entrenched gender inequalities that prevent their achieving financial independence and business success.<br>Typically, Burundian society does not accept girls supporting themselves and gaining independence, as this pushes the envelope of acceptable gender norms and makes girls undesirable for marriage. &nbsp;CARE Burundi learned during the POWER Africa project that to overcome these obstacles, so that girls can lead themselves out of poverty, the support of the community, teachers, parents and brothers is crucial to girls’ stability and safety necessary to start businesses and invest their profits. Adolescent girls and some of their parents are determined to access opportunities and break the cycle of inequality, but rather than being offered support, they are often pressured into submission.</p>

Adolescent girls lead&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">different lives with different experiences.

Nor can they be treated as adults who may be unfamiliar&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">with new technologies and more cautious in their businesses. They may be in or out of school. Many&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">still live at home.

Parents, teachers, brothers, men, business owners, and all levels of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">government needed to be involved in enabling and activating all aspects of agency, relations and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">structure. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Parents can make life difficult for girls in rural Burundi.

            <p class="mbr-text align-right pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-7">There are clear tensions. With girls’ increasingly defined sense of agency in terms of self-determination and continuing business growth and success, there is an inherent tension between girls’ growing their businesses and finishing their studies. Many girls feel that if their business is going well, school provides no benefits and there is no reason to return to school if they have found success despite their lack of education. This is a particularly pertinent question for POWER participants who have children. This in direct contrast to the goals and aspirations of parents, teachers, local and international NGOs, and government policies and development plans.<br><br>Data collected from POWER surveys may support teachers’ fears that the girls would drop out of school. In the early stages of the project, 55% of girls received primary school education, with 40% completing secondary school. <br>From the most recent data, 32% of VSLA members and 30.5% of non-members are currently in school. This represents a clear difference from previous cohorts. <br>For example, in 2015, 40% of VSLA members reported currently attending school, compared to 27% of non-members. The current data indicates an 8% decrease in school attendance among VSLA members. <br>There is a simple explanation for the decline in VSLA members currently in school. They are getting older. Yet the increasing age of the girls surveyed does not explain the full picture. There is a growing trend throughout POWER Africa whereby girls, particularly those who have their own children, often choose not to attend school in order to dedicate their time to their businesses.<br><br>The high dropout rate is a continuous trend across each year of the project. The girls invest more time and funding in their businesses as profits grow, which in turn could compromise school attendance. When asked if they had ever left school, 20% of members aged 11-15 said that they had. This proportion increased to 43.3% in the 16-20 year old age group.<br><br>In line with this trend, adolescent girls do not appear to prioritise investment in their education. Only 7.2% of VSLA members use their share out funds for school fees, the minority of respondents, with fewer girls in school than out of school in the survey sample.<br><br>Regarding business revenue, 10% of VSLA members use their revenue for school fees, which is comparable to non-members. The majority, 44%, of members reinvest their revenue in their businesses. Neither VSLA members nor non-members use loans to pay for schools.

If we are to respect girls’ as their own agents and in defining their own agency, then do we accept their assessment that building their businesses and earning money to provide for their and their family’s futures? Or, do we place a limit on how far that agency should go?<div><br></div><div>Because POWER let girls progress at their own pace with their income generating activities (IGAs) and&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">businesses, and encouraged their ideas, adolescent girls are essentially treated as adults and provided with the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">space to develop their own definition of agency. What makes adolescent girls special is that in defining their&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">own agency they are not confined by boundaries or restricted in their aspirations – like teenagers the world&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">over - and will push to change the status quo.</span></div></h3>

A few months later, the Abatangamucho ran a gender equality training session for the men in the community. They spoke about the sharing of gender-specific roles and responsibilities. <br>This gave Charlotte an idea: she could become a bicycle-taxi driver,<br>a job typically reserved for boys and men. &nbsp;Adolescent girls in POWER have been shown to be innovative, to move quickly and are willing to<br>take calculated risks in taking loans and venturing into non-traditional businesses. In a word, they are dynamic.<br>They have a growing capacity for financial education, as well as business and money management and apply these skills to undertake higher value business activities. These skills enable them to invest<br>in land, building or buying houses, cows, small animals, bicycles, motorcycles, sewing machines and their own or their children’s education. <br>Many of these investments are traditionally reserved for<br>men’s control and ownership.</p>

They leverage success in&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">one market to pursue success in another. For example, they take a loan to buy tomatoes to sell,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">which they make a profit on; they use these profits to buy piglets; they sell the sow (the female), and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">use these profits to buy land.</span></p><p>Charlotte is still studying and operates her taxi business outside of school hours.

They begin by running a small business while building capital,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">expand into a more lucrative sector while continuing to run their original business, and collect&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">assets, like livestock or land, along the way.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Accruing land and assets is a form of security for girls against theft – resilience in the face of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">instability. POWER data showed more VSLA members reported investing in assets than non-VSLA&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">members, 85.8% and 61.8%, respectively. Land is harder to come by, with only 6.8% of members&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">reporting purchasing land in the past 12 months, yet it confers more benefits in terms of legally&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">being in girls’ names and unable to be seized.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">As adolescent girls in Burundi establish and expand their businesses, they add value to their&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">communities through job creation, which is multifaceted. By hiring employees, girls benefit in&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">business growth, as this enables them to manage their time between multiple businesses, and to&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">increase their productivity. It also shifts gender norms, demonstrating women’s capacity for&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">leadership and business acumen. In some cases those norms are flipped as girls are hiring boys as&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">assistants.</span></p></div>

                <p class="mbr-text align-center display-5 pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-7">The success of girls’ businesses posed a dilemma for the POWER Africa project. As their businesses grew and flourished, girls were unable to access enough credit through their VSLA groups to cover their loan needs for continued business growth. Some members were joining two or three groups to obtain multiple loans. They wanted to be linked into the formal banking system for greater security and access to higher loans and credit.<br>The VSLA programme did not allow for the speed with which adolescent girls progressed through trainings and grew their businesses. Girls and community members expressed a clear demand to enter the formal banking system for linkage for security of assets, but CARE follows a ‘do no harm’ approach and was worried linkage could lead to negative consequences.<br>CARE was slow to react to the demand, cautious of which bank the groups could link with and what impact it<br>would have. <br>Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) approached CARE during the first year of the project looking to link with VSLA groups and consistently pursued CARE to form a partnership and connect them with groups.<br>However, this supply-driven approach is in direct contradiction to POWER’s client-driven approach in best meeting the needs of adolescent girls. CARE slowed down the process with KCB to better focus on quality and its ‘do no harm’ approach.<br>The decision to pursue linkage, at least primarily through further research, was accompanied by a ramping up<br>of Abatangamucho presence in communities in responding to this concern. The key question for CARE was –<br>how do you know when it’s time to link? The challenge is tempering a demand, client-driven approach, against<br>the ‘do no harm’ principles inherent to working with young adolescent girls.<br><br>CARE Burundi conducted market research on financial linkage of VSLAs in Burundi to explore the possibility of<br>formal financial linkage of VSLAs, particularly those of young adolescent girls. This determined the best<br>financial institutions for linkage in the Burundian context, and provided guidelines for CARE on preparing<br>groups, individual members, banks, and other regulators for linkage in adequately defining the process.<br>Ultimately, KCB was chosen as the best partner according to fees, transfers, access to bank accounts, and<br>transfer costs. It was also important to consider the stability of the institution; financial services providers<br>(FSPs), particularly microfinance institutions (MFIs), have a history of instability in Burundi that has left many<br>Burundians wary of linkage. KCB’s products were sound and they took the initiative to go to the villages with<br>CARE to train and speak to girls. Additionally, KCB works through a network of agents that earn commission<br>from the bank and are mobile throughout their areas, thus providing adequate access to the different target<br>communities. Further, KCB had a mobile money option available, again increasing girls’ access to products and<br>services.<br></p>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><p>This was followed by ongoing negotiation with banks on products, trainings and resources for hard to reach&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">locations across the target communities, and a pilot of savings-only bank accounts for 20 groups. To begin this&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">process, GLID mobilised and sensitised groups on the possibilities for linkage, the benefits and asked if they&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">wanted to link. Girls were given time to think about this, and were told to approach their field officers if they&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">were interested, after which they set up a meeting with KCB. </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Mobilising and speaking with groups can help to&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">mitigate the problem of gaining consensus among group members to link. In these joint meetings between&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">KCB and the groups, KCB explained their products and services to the girls, and girls provided feedback and ask&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">questions. </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">This step was undertaken even prior to CARE signing a Memorandum of Understanding with KCB;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">this was because CARE wanted to make sure that girls’ opinions, concerns, and ideas were included in the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">bank’s product design process and ensure this feedback was incorporated into their negotiations.</span></p><p></p><div>In continuing the participatory nature of these processes, when the pilot phase is completed, CARE will use the&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">community scorecard to evaluate the process, services and products so that KCB, CARE, GLID and the girls can&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">provide feedback and engage in discussion to continuing improving this process and products.</span></div><p></p></div>

                <p class="mbr-text align-center display-5 pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-7">A key issue that often obstructs linkage can be the ‘Know Your Customer’ requirements to prevent fraudulent<br>behaviour, as this often necessitates all group members having ID cards and proof of group status. Fortunately,<br>with the support and involvement of both the local and national government, CARE was able to present a list<br>of all groups and these members to the government and the administrators to confirm that the girls are in<br>groups and to issue them with a pass that CARE provides directly to KCB. CARE advocated to the government<br>for this support, arguing that youth should not be blocked from financial inclusion by an administrative factor,<br>particularly as it can be difficult for youth to obtain ID cards.<br><br>At the end of 2016, 6.6% of groups are linked to KCB, and 60.5% of VSLA members report that they would like<br>to open an account, compared to 54.9% of non-members, highlighting the progressive nature and improved<br>financial knowledge of VSLA members. Add to the former figure the 13.1% of members that already have<br>accounts, and it can be determined that 73.6% of members either are active financially or would like to engage<br>with formal services.<br><br>In pursuing a demand, client-driven approach, there is a sense that CARE needed to be nimbler and progress<br>faster to better respond to girls’ needs. The lapse between the initial demands from the girls’ for linkage for<br>valid reasons of security and the actual commencement of linkage was not responsive. This is evidenced by the<br>fact that by they began the linkage pilot, girls were demanding linkage for reasons of business growth and the<br>need for higher value loans. Again, it can be difficult to temper this demand against the due diligence required<br>for a ‘do no harm’ approach. There are also concerns around account usage that highlight the need for<br>ongoing engagement – 5% of linked VSLA members use accounts only once per year and 27% only twice per<br>year. This low usage rate implies that members are either too far from the bank branch and do not have easy<br>access to deposit or withdrawal services in the absence of mobile banking, or that they simply are not making<br>use of their accounts.<br><br><br></p>
